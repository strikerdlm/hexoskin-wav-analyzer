# Python app

- only write python files with the best practices
- Keep code files max 300 lines and make another python file if needed
- make the code easy to maintain
- Not necessary to make bat or bash files
- Update the requirements if needed but do not delete requirements.txt, check if they have incompatibility issues
- maintain UTF-8
- Each app should have its own folder to keep the project organized
- make sure you do not delete functioning code, please keep restore points
