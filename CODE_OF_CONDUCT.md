# Code of Conduct - Valquiria Data Analysis Suite

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Valquiria Data Analysis Suite community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on advancing space medicine research and physiological data analysis.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- **Scientific Rigor**: Maintaining high standards for research quality and methodology
- **Respectful Communication**: Using welcoming and inclusive language
- **Constructive Collaboration**: Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- **Professional Focus**: Keeping discussions centered on technical and scientific matters
- **Graceful Feedback**: Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- **Community Responsibility**: Focusing on what is best for the overall community and research goals
- **Acknowledgment**: Showing empathy and kindness toward other community members

### Research Ethics

As this is a research project involving physiological data:

- **Data Privacy**: Respect participant confidentiality and data protection regulations
- **Scientific Integrity**: Maintain honesty in research methods and reporting
- **Proper Attribution**: Give credit to original authors and data sources
- **Responsible Use**: Remember this is for research purposes only, not operational deployment

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Harassment**: The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- **Discrimination**: Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- **Privacy Violations**: Publishing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit permission
- **Unprofessional Conduct**: Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- **Research Misconduct**: Falsifying data, plagiarism, or misrepresenting research methods
- **Misuse Warning**: Attempting to use this research software for operational military or clinical purposes

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [contact information]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Research-Specific Issues

For issues related to:
- **Data misuse or privacy concerns**: Contact the research team immediately
- **Scientific misconduct**: Report through institutional channels
- **Misuse for operational purposes**: Contact Dr. Diego Malpica and the FAC research team

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Special Considerations for Research Community

### Scientific Discourse

- **Peer Review**: Constructive criticism of research methods is encouraged and expected
- **Data Requests**: Reasonable requests for clarification or additional analysis should be handled professionally
- **Methodology Disputes**: Technical disagreements should focus on methods, not personal characteristics
- **Collaboration**: International and interdisciplinary collaboration is encouraged

### Medical and Aerospace Context

- **Professional Standards**: Contributors should maintain standards appropriate for medical and aerospace research
- **Regulatory Awareness**: Understand and respect regulatory frameworks (FDA, ESA, etc.)
- **Safety Focus**: Always prioritize participant and user safety in research and software design
