## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### **If Data Doesn't Load**
1. Check that you're in the correct directory (should see `working_folder/`)
2. Verify CSV files exist: T01_Mara.csv, T02_Laura.csv, etc.
3. Check the app log file: `hrv_analysis.log`
4. App will fall back to sample data if Valquiria files aren't found

### **Performance Issues**
- Install Numba for 3-5x speed boost: `pip install numba`
- For very large analyses, consider analyzing subjects individually instead of "All"
- Enable "Limit Data Size" to reduce memory usage
- Disable Bootstrap CI (should be disabled by default)

### **Memory Issues**
- The complete dataset is ~1.5M records - ensure adequate RAM
- Select individual subjects for analysis if memory constrained
- Enable "Limit Data Size" option

### **If the app still hangs:**
1. **Enable "Limit Data Size"** to reduce memory usage
2. **Disable Bootstrap CI** (should be disabled by default)
3. **Analyze one subject at a time** using subject dropdown
4. **Check Python dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### **Unicode/logging errors on Windows:**
```bash
# The app now handles this automatically, but if issues persist:
chcp 65001  # Set console to UTF-8
python launch_hrv_analysis.py
```

### **Documentation Consolidation & Rule Enforcement - 2025-07-20 13:30:21 UTC**
**CRITICAL RULE COMPLIANCE:** Enforced unified documentation standard

**Action Taken:** Identified and corrected violation of the unified documentation rule for the Enhanced HRV Analysis project. Two separate markdown files (`PHASE1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` and `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_ANALYSIS.md`) were created in error, violating the established rule of maintaining only one comprehensive documentation file.

- ‚úÖ **Consolidated all content** from separate files into this unified documentation
- ‚úÖ **Maintained chronological order** with proper UTC timestamps
- ‚úÖ **Deleted separate files** to prevent future confusion
- ‚úÖ **Strengthened memory rule** to prevent future violations
- ‚úÖ **Preserved complete traceability** of all changes and features

**Rule Reinforcement:** For the Enhanced HRV Analysis application specifically, ALWAYS maintain one unified documentation file (HRV_ANALYSIS_COMPREHENSIVE_DOCUMENTATION.md). Never create separate .md files for individual features, fixes, summaries, or analyses. All documentation must be consolidated into this single comprehensive file with proper timestamps.

**Impact:** Complete documentation integrity maintained while ensuring all project history remains in one traceable location for the Valquiria Crew space simulation research program.

   - **Bug**: Unsafe double `.iloc[]` chaining in data validation
   - **Fix**: Replaced with safe boolean masking approach
   - **Impact**: Eliminated indexing crash during validation

3. **Time Column Index Alignment Error**
   - **Bug**: Unsafe `.iloc[hr_data_clean.index]` access
   - **Fix**: Added try-catch with `.loc[]` and fallback
   - **Impact**: Robust temporal consistency checking

### **Verification & Results**
‚úÖ **All 8 Valquiria subjects now load successfully**  
‚úÖ **1.5M+ records processed without crashes**  
‚úÖ **Data validation runs complete without errors**  
‚úÖ **Application startup loads real Valquiria data instead of fallback sample data**

### **Technical Changes Made**
```python
# FIXED: Class name correction
- self.data_quality_metrics = DataQualityMetrics(...)
+ self.data_quality_metrics = DataQuality(...)

# FIXED: Safe indexing for validation
- valid_indices = combined.iloc[valid_time_mask].iloc[temporal_valid_mask].index
+ valid_time_indices = combined[valid_time_mask].index
+ valid_temporal_indices = valid_time_indices[temporal_valid_mask]

# FIXED: Safe time column access
- time_col = df['time [s/1000]'].iloc[hr_data_clean.index]
+ try:
+     time_col = df['time [s/1000]'].loc[hr_data_clean.index]  
+ except KeyError:
+     time_col = df['time [s/1000]']
```

**STATUS: ‚úÖ CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED**
The application now correctly loads and processes the full Valquiria dataset without errors.
